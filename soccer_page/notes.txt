Here is an example of a page layout using css and html.

The way the code is written now assumes that you have 
the following three files in your directory:
	page.html  		<- containing the html text below
	style.css  		<- containing the css text below(er)
	picture.jpg		<- being some picture

These names are not required, but whatever name you choose
has to match what you write in the html.

This layout is just here for you to practice getting a page working. 
Choose your own topic, play around with the numbers, change the colors,
change the borders/padding/margins to how you like it. Make it your own!
There is still much to be done to make this page look great...
